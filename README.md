# course-support

This repository contains material related to the support of Computer Science courses
at the University of California, Riverside. 

## Course Specific Material

The material that is used by for each course is linked below.

- [CS 010B](/courses/cs010b/README.md)
- [CS 100](/courses/cs100/README.md)

Note: If a course you are taking isn't listed here, that likely means it is using
some software that isn't documented here yet, for example use of VirtualBox in CS 164
In that case, some of the content on specific technologies (such as Visual Studio Code) 
in the section on technologies below may still be useful to you.

## Learning Modules for Technologies

Some technologies such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and 
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) are widely used in industry, and also 
available for use in CS courses. There's some content about how to use them in CS 
courses below; this can be used to learn these technologies for the first time, or 
as a refresher.  If you are in a specific course, only some of this material may be 
used.  You can refer to the Course Specific Material section above to see 
what material is relevant to any specific course.
