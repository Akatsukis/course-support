# Setting up Docker in VSCode

## What is Docker?
- First explain what images and containers are
    - A template for creating a container that can be built upon with layers (image)
        - ***Is there a better way to explain this?***
    - A lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application (containers) (taken from Docker website)
    - A set of instructions used to create a docker image (Dockerfile)
    - Pros of a VM without their cons
    - ***Note: Since this is moreso about configuration of Docker and a tutorial about how to use given images/Dockerfiles, should we go over how to create Dockerfiles?***
    - ***How in depth should this context be?***
## Why Docker?

- “Why use Docker for courses?”
    - A convenient way to get all software needed for a given course, allowing for easy setup
    - Experience with docker and containerization, something that is extraordinarily popular (hyperlink to some statistic that backs this claim up)
    - Since containers work on any machine, removes the complexity of setup
