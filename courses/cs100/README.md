The topics relevant to CS 100 are:

- [Introduction to the Linux Filesystem and Submitting Code to Zybooks](/learning_modules/vscode/linux-file-system-and-submission/README.md) The content specific to Zybooks can be ignored if that is not what the current offering of the course is using.

- [Debugging with Recursion](/learning_modules/vscode/debugging-recursion/README.md)
